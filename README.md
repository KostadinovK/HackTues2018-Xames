# Xames 

Xames is a mobile app, that contains several logical games.
It is made by THE ERRORs.
The logical games are based on math, algorithms and logic from the distant past.
They are fascinating and cause desirability for understanding them on a deeper level.
Your aim is to find out the "always-winning" algorithm by learning how to use graphic methods, method of mathematical induction 
to prove unusual theorems.
The successful participation in a game should be well thought in advance.
There are some historical facts for each one of the games - when or where it appears, who found the "not-losing" algorithm, etc.

## Bachet Game

You can choose single player or multi player
If you choose multi player - you and your opponent should stand one versus another.
At each turn the player can take from one to five objects from the common group.
Each of you take turns and the goal is to make your opponent take the last object.
If he takes he last object, you are the winner! Woohoo!

## Dudeney Game

One after another are playing two players.
At each turn, each of them can complete the common group with objects, by placing from 1 to a number objects, but their amount must not be equal to the quantity the previous player has put up. 
The winner is the player, who in his turn succeed in decreasing the amount of objects in the group to a given number or to create a situation, where the opponent always exceeds the given value.

## Even Mania

This game is also played by two people.
In the beginning there is one group, that contains odd number of objects.
Both of the players control one circular object in a coordinate system.
They have to input numbers from 1 to 5 to move it in specific directions.
Player 1 moves the object on the X axis, and Player 2 - on the Y axis.
When one's turn comes, he chooses a number from one to five and this way he collects that number of objects.
The game ends when the object, the players are moving, passes the diagonal line, made by the two biggest X and Y coordinates (15 - 15).
